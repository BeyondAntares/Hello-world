# Hello-world

## About me:
I've worn many hats varrying from being an Electrical Engineer, working in sales, marketing, business Development, 
consulting, strategy to working in Finance. Having coded extensively some 10 years ago, I've picked it 
up again as a hobby to explore all the new developments out there. Happy to take feedback to tailor the material
to make it as user friendly and easy to pick up as possible. 

I understand coding is challenging and sometimes not that fun. If there's no challenge then we're not learning
anything new. Let me break down as many barriers that newcomers face to help people get on track and 
onto bigger and more exciting projects. The blogs and this site isn't designed to replace text books or online
course materials. Think of it as a tl;dr (too long; didn't read) version of the journey. 

So come and join me for the ride!
